## My Task
What the does Are You Smarter Than A Coder project do? Why the project is useful?
As a full-stack web developer, usually during the interview process I would be asked to take a typical coding assessment. In this weeks homework I am assigned to create a quiz typically used in interviews which includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

This weekâ€™s homework I am instructed to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions which will run in the browser. It will feature updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

## Story
